# My Note Keeper REST API
A REST API using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for a note-keeping application. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on their notes and it's also connected to a MongoDB database and uses Mongoose for object modelling.

## Each note contains:
1. Title
2. Content
3. Creation date.
   
## Features:
- **`GET /notes`**: Retrieve all notes.
- **`GET /notes/:id`**: Retrieve a specific note using its ID.
- **`POST /notes`**: Add a new note.
- **`DELETE /notes/:id`**: Delete a specific note using its ID.
- **`PATCH /notes/:id`**: Update a specific note using its ID.
